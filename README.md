## Overview

### The challenge - challenge was more difficult than I had imagined, mainly because it was one of the first ones I did alone. a few hours of research to resolve the application doubts of some elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
 -Pseudos Element
-Pseudo Class

##What I learned - In the challenge was used to practice all the concepts that I have learned so far, some challenges with the use of pseudo elements, and the hover states there is a need for a lot of research to understand the elements and how to apply them .
